"When you first install oTree, The entire admin interface is accessible "

"To put your site online in public demo mode where anybody can play a demo"

"The session-wide link lets you provide the same start link to all "

"parameter in the URL (see :ref:`participant_label`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:63
msgid ""
"Before using the session-wide link, consider using a :ref:`room <rooms>`,"
" because you can also use a room without a participant label file to "
"allow everyone to play with the same URL. The advantage of using a room "
"is that the URL is simpler to type (doesn't contain a randomly generated "

"First, define a method ``vars_for_admin_report`` on the Subsession. This "
