"If your game has multiple rounds, a player could have different colors in"
" different rounds, because ``creating_session`` gets executed for each "
"round independently. To prevent this, set it on the participant, rather "
"than the player:"

"The above code makes a random drawing independently for each player, so "

msgid ""
"In a live experiment, you often want to give a player a random treatment."
" But when you are testing your game, it is often useful to choose "
"explicitly which treatment to play. Let's say you are developing the game"
" from the above example and want to show your colleagues both treatments "
"(red and blue). You can create 2 session configs that are the same, "
"except for ``color`` (in oTree Studio, add a \"custom parameter\"):"

"Then in your code you can get the current session's color with "
"``self.session.config['color'].``"

#: ../../source/treatments.rst:100

"You can even combine this with the randomization approach. You can check "
"``if 'color' in self.session.config:``; if yes, then use that color; if "
"no, then choose it randomly."

"For example, let's say you have a \"num_apples\" parameter. The usual "
"approach would be to define it in ``Constants``, e.g. "
"``Constants.num_apples``. But to make it configurable, you can instead "
"define it in your session config. For example:"
