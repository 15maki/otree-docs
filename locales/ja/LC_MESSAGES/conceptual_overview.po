"A session is a series of subsessions; subsessions are the \"sections\" or"
" \"modules\" that constitute a session. For example, if a session "
"consists of a public goods game followed by a questionnaire, the public "
"goods game would be subsession 1, and the questionnaire would be "
"subsession 2. In turn, each subsession is a sequence of pages. For "
"example, if you had a 4-page public goods game followed by a 2-page "
"questionnaire:"
