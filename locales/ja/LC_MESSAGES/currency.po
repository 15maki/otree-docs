"In many experiments, participants play for currency: either real money, "
"or points. oTree supports both; you can switch from points to real money "
"by setting ``USE_POINTS = False`` in ``settings.py``."

"In your Python code, you can indicate a currency amount with ``c()``, "
"e.g. ``c(10)`` or ``c(0)``. It will still work just like a number (e.g. "
"``c(1) + c(0.2) == c(1.2)``). The advantage is that when it's displayed "
"to users, it will automatically be formatted as ``$1.20`` or ``1,20 â‚¬``, "
"etc., depending on your ``REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_CODE`` and "
"``LANGUAGE_CODE`` settings."

"In templates, instead of using the ``c()`` function, you should use the "

"Each player has a ``payoff`` field. If your player makes money, you "
"should store it in this field. ``participant.payoff`` automatically "
"stores the sum of payoffs from all subsessions. You can modify "
"``participant.payoff`` directly, e.g. to round the final payoff to a "
"whole number."

"At the end of the experiment, a participant's total profit can be "
"accessed by ``participant.payoff_plus_participation_fee()``; it is "
"calculated by converting ``participant.payoff`` to real-world currency "
"(if ``USE_POINTS`` is ``True``), and then adding "
"``session.config['participation_fee']``."

"On the other hand, points are integers. This means amounts will get "
"rounded to whole numbers, like ``10`` divided by ``3`` is ``3``. So, we "
"recommend using point magnitudes high enough that you don't care about "
"rounding error. For example, set the endowment of a game to 1000 points, "
"rather than 100."
