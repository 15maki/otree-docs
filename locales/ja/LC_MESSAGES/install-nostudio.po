"The best way to ensure that your apps continue to work after you upgrade "
"is to use only the functions described in this documentation. Some code "
"snippets you may find online were written by people who access oTree's "
"internal functions and \"hack\" them to do something different. Although "
"these snippets can enable some innovative new functionality, be aware "
"that they increase the chance of things breaking when you upgrade. "
"Because oTree's internal code layout changes from release to release."
