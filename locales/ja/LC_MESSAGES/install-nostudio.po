"The best way to ensure that your apps continue to work after you upgrade "

"internal functions and \"hack\" them to do something different. Although "
"these snippets can enable some innovative new functionality, be aware "
"that they increase the chance of things breaking when you upgrade, "
"because oTree's internal code layout changes from release to release."
