"By default, participants will not see messages that were sent before they"

"When a player loads the page, your JavaScript can call something like "

"If you have a form with multiple fields, it may be simpler to use a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:250
msgid ""
"Let's say your live page asks players to submit bids, and the maximum bid"
" is 99. In a non-live page you would check this using :ref:`form-"
"validation`. But with live pages, you must verify it inside the "
"``live_method``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:265
msgid ""
"In addition, you can add attributes to the ``<input>`` element like "
"``max=\"99\"``. (But note HTML code is not secure and can be modified by "
"tech-savvy participants.) If you do this, you should also add "
"``form=\"liveform\"``. This will exclude that ``<input>`` from the page's"
" main form, so that when the user clicks the ``{% next_button %}``, the "
"validation will not be triggered ."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:271
msgid "So, it looks like this:"

#: ../../source/live.rst:277

"To trigger validation when the user submits the bid, use this (e.g. in "
"your ``onclick`` handler):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:285
msgid ""
"``reportValidity()`` is a built-in JavaScript function that will show the"
" user any errors in their form fields. It also returns a boolean that "
"tells if the form is currently valid. You can use that to skip the "

msgid ""
"Here is some general advice (does not apply to all situations). We "
"recommend implementing most of your logic in Python, and just using "
"JavaScript to update the page's HTML, because:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:296
msgid "The JavaScript language can be quite tricky to use properly"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:297
msgid ""
"Your Python code runs on the server, which is centralized and reliable. "
"JavaScript runs on the clients, which can get out of sync with each "
"other, and data can get lost when the page is closed or reloaded."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:300
msgid ""
"Because Python code runs on the server, it is more secure and cannot be "
"viewed or modified by participants."

msgid "Example: tic-tac-toe"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:306
msgid ""
"Let's say you are implementing a game of tic-tac-toe. There are 2 types "
"of messages your live_method can receive:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:309
msgid "A user marks a square, so you need to notify the other player"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:310
msgid ""
"A user loads (or reloads) the page, so you need to send them the current "
"board layout."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:312
msgid ""
"For situation 1, you should use a JavaScript event handler like "
"``onclick``, e.g. so when the user clicks on square 3, that move gets "
"sent to the server:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:319
msgid ""
"For situation 2, it's good to put some code like this in your template, "
"which sends an empty message to the server when the page loads:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:328
msgid "The server handles these 2 situations with an \"if\" statement:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:355
msgid ""
"In situation 2 (the player loads the page), the client gets a message "
"like:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:361
msgid ""
"In situation 1, the player gets the update about the move that was just "
"made, AND the current state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:367
msgid ""
"The JavaScript code can be \"dumb\". It doesn't need to keep track of "
"whose move it is; it just trusts the info it receives from the server. It"
" can even redraw the board each time it receives a message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:371
msgid ""
"Your code will also need to validate user input. For example, if player 1"
" tries to move when it is actually player 2's turn, you need to block "
"that. For reasons listed in the previous section, it's better to do this "
"in your live_method than in JavaScript code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summary"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:378
msgid "As illustrated above, the typical pattern for a live_method is like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:392
msgid ""
"Note that we get the game's state twice. That's because the state changes"
" when we update our models, so we need to refresh it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:396
msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:397
msgid ""
"If you call ``liveSend`` before the page has finished loading, you will "
"get an error like ``liveSend is not defined``. So, wait for "
"``DOMContentLoaded`` (or jQuery document.ready, etc):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/live.rst:407
msgid ""
"Don't trigger ``liveSend`` when the user clicks the \"next\" button, "
"since leaving the page might interrupt the ``liveSend``. Instead, have "
"the user click a regular button that triggers a ``liveSend``, and then "
"doing ``document.getElementById(\"form\").submit();`` in your "
"``liveRecv``."
