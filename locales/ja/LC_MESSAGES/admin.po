msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:14
msgid ""
"When you first install oTree, The entire admin interface is accessible "
"without a password. However, when you are ready to deploy to your "
"audience, you should password protect the admin."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:18
msgid ""
"If you are launching an experiment and want visitors to only be able to "
"play your app if you provided them with a start link, set the environment"
" variable ``OTREE_AUTH_LEVEL`` to ``STUDY``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:22
msgid ""
"To put your site online in public demo mode where anybody can play a demo"
" version of your game (but not access the full admin interface), set "
"``OTREE_AUTH_LEVEL`` to ``DEMO``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:27

"The normal admin username is \"admin\". You should set your password in "

msgid "Rooms"

#: ../../source/admin.rst:42
msgid ""
"In most cases where you are doing a study, the best way to set up URLs is"
" to make a :ref:`room <rooms>`."

msgid "Single-use links"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:50
msgid ""
"If a room is not suited for your needs, you can use oTree's single-use "
"links. Every time you create a session, you will need to re-distribute "
"URLs to each participant."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:56
msgid "Session-wide link"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:58
msgid ""
"The session-wide link lets you provide the same start link to all "
"participants in the session. Note: this may result in the same "
"participant playing twice, unless you use the ``participant_label`` "
"parameter in the URL (see :ref:`participant_label`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:63
msgid ""
"Before using the session-wide link, consider using a :ref:`room <rooms>`,"
" because you can also use a room without a participant label file to "
"allow everyone to play with the same URL. The advantage of using a room "
"is that the URL is simpler to type (doesn't contain a randomly generated "
"code), and you can reuse it across sessions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:73
msgid "Participant labels"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:75
msgid ""
"Whether or not you're using a :ref:`room <rooms>`, you can append a "
"``participant_label`` parameter to each participant's start URL to "
"identify them, e.g. by name, ID number, or computer workstation. For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:82
msgid ""
"oTree will record this participant label. It will be used to identify "
"that participant in the oTree admin interface and the payments page, etc."
" You can also access it from your code as ``participant.label``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:87
msgid ""
"Another benefit of participant labels is that if the participant opens "
"their start link twice, they will be assigned back to the same "
"participant (if you are using a room-wide or session-wide URL). This "
"reduces duplicate participation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:91
msgid ""
"If you're using Prolific, you can add "
"``participant_label={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}`` to your study URL. When the user"

"actual Prolific ID."

"Here is a trivial example, where we add an admin report that displays a "
"sorted list of payoffs for a given round."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/admin.rst:120
msgid ""
"First, define a function ``vars_for_admin_report``. This works the same "
"way as :ref:`vars_for_template`. For example:"

"``admin_report.html`` does not need to use ``{% block %}`` or ``{% "
