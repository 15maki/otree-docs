To edit:

-   Clone this repo
-   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
-   Build by running ``./make html`` from the root directory.
-   If the HTML output looks OK, then you can push & make a pull request.
-   The content on [otree.readthedocs.org](http://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
    is built only when a push is made to the oTree-org/otree-docs repo.
    For example, if you make a commit directly in the web interface,
    it will not build until the next push is made.
