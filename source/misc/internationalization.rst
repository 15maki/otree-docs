Localization
============

Changing the language setting
-----------------------------

Go to your settings and change ``LANGUAGE_CODE``:.

For example::

    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'fr' # French
    LANGUAGE_CODE = 'zh-hans' # Chinese (simplified)

This will customize certain things such validation messages and formatting of numbers.

Writing your app in multiple languages
--------------------------------------

You may want your own app to work in multiple languages.
For example, let's say you want to run the same experiment with English, French, and Chinese participants.

For an example, see the "multi_language" app `here <https://www.otreehub.com/projects/otree-snippets/>`__.
